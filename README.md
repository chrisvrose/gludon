# gludon

## Why?
This has a pre-setup C/C++ template for working with openGL.
GLAD is with OpenGL4.1 basic and should be enough for most academic work.
Additionally, shaders are included by using #include<>, so that linting and checking still works on the separate files.

Configured with the following dependencies (All done via git submodules):
- Glad - OpenGL 4.1
- GLFW - v3.3
- STB - Texture loading
- GLM - v0.9.9.8

## Usage

Download it via cloning
**Important: Remember to initialize submodules or recurse while cloning**

```
git clone git@github.com:chrisvrose/gludon.git --recurse-submodules
```

If you have already cloned it, and need to get the submodules/update dependencies
```
git submodule update
```
